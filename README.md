Blocks game

A Background:
From when I started to learn how to code in C++ at school, I was fond of building games. 
Not the exquisitely built, single-multiplayer strategy game but the simple ones like Hangman, Cows and Bulls and the like. The sort of games jokingly called "old-people" games. 
(Maybe it was because I spent way too much time as a young kid playing Spider Solitaire, Mahjongg, Minesweeper, Sokoban, Freecell, etc.)
Whenever I had project work in my CS courses, I tried my best to choose one involving games. Then, life happened, I changed tacks and did not code at all for many years.
A few years back, when I was scrolling through my Youtube feed, I saw a link to a video on web scraping (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11y4N25ju8) from CS50 on Twitch. That took me down the rabbit-hole of other CS50 Live videos some of involved live-coding games. I was hooked, dusted my coding skillsets and programmed a game in Love2D using the code from those videos as a starter.  
It rekindled my love for coding, particularly coding those 200-300 line games that I used to make intended for myself to play. I did not code often after that but when I did, I tried out things I hadn't learnt earlier like Processing or p5.js, Haskell (which was so removed from the imperative programming I was used to). I felt (and still feel) like a dinosaur placed in the modern world when I look at the advances in today's programming world, including Github Copilot. It's a fascinating, intimidating and exhilarating time to be someone who codes.
Like many, I too had a bucketlist of things to do in my early 20s. As I near a birthday, I look back only to realize that I haven't checked many things in that list. One of things was to build the blocks game like on those early videogames, which seemed do-able. The end result of working on that, using only vanilla Javascript and HTML is this game. 
Like me, it's not perfect, complex or captivating. But it mostly does what it needs to and that seems enough for today! 
I treat the games I code as old friends - I revisit them at times and even if they don't bring anything new & are free of frills, the familiarity & memories of the good-old-times is as comforting as a warm hug.
If you are played this game, thank you :) and hope it brought you the tiniest amount of joy for a few seconds of your day! 

TLDR: This is my version of a beloved game, written as a (maybe dubious?) birthday gift. Should run on most browsers.

P.S. The Javascript part is a bit messy but in the short time I had to make this version, couldn't study or understand the prototype and the class models in Javascript. Apologies!
